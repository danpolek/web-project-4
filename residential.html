            <h2>Your Home in the Heart of the Community</h2>
            <p>Naawi-Oodena offers diverse housing options designed through extensive community consultation to meet the needs of all residents while honoring Indigenous values of community and connection to land. Our residential areas combine modern urban living with the rich cultural heritage of Treaty One Nations, creating spaces that are both functional and spiritually meaningful.</p>
            
            <p>The development features a carefully planned mix of housing types, from single-family homes to modern apartments, all designed with sustainability and community connection in mind. The residential districts are organized according to traditional Indigenous principles of community design, with circular neighborhood layouts that promote social interaction and connection to nature. Each cluster of homes shares communal green spaces designed for both recreation and traditional uses like medicine harvesting.</p>
            
            <p>What sets Naawi-Oodena apart is how Indigenous knowledge informs every aspect of residential life - from the east-facing entrances that welcome the morning sun, to the use of natural materials that connect buildings to the land, to the integration of cultural spaces throughout the neighborhoods where residents can participate in ceremonies and celebrations.</p>

    <!-- ===== CULTURAL DESIGN ELEMENTS ===== -->
    <section class="section">

        <h2 class="text-center">Cultural Design Elements</h2>
        <p class="text-center intro-text">Every aspect of Naawi-Oodena's residential design incorporates Indigenous knowledge and cultural values, creating spaces that honor tradition while meeting modern needs. Our design principles were developed in consultation with Elders and knowledge keepers from the Treaty One Nations.</p>
        
        <div class="card-grid">
          <div class="card">
            <img src="img/sacred-geometry.jpg" alt="Circular neighborhood design" class="card-img">
            <h3>Sacred Geometry</h3>
            <p>Building layouts incorporate traditional circular patterns representing unity, wholeness, and the cycles of life. Neighborhoods are arranged in concentric circles with communal spaces at the center, reflecting traditional camp layouts. Homes are oriented to the four directions, with east-facing entrances to welcome the morning sun in accordance with Anishinaabe traditions.</p>
            <p>The circular designs extend to architectural details like rounded corners, circular windows, and curved pathways that encourage mindful movement through space. These elements create a physical manifestation of Indigenous worldviews where all things are interconnected.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <img src="img/natural-materials.jpg" alt="Home featuring wood and stone elements" class="card-img">
            <h3>Natural Materials</h3>
            <p>We prioritize the use of wood, stone, and other materials significant to Indigenous cultures, sourced sustainably whenever possible. Cedar is used extensively for its cultural and practical properties - as both exterior cladding and interior finishes for its aromatic and insect-repellent qualities.</p>
            <p>Local limestone appears in foundations and feature walls, connecting buildings to the land. Other traditional materials like birch bark are incorporated artistically in select locations. Modern sustainable materials are chosen to complement these traditional elements, creating a blend of ancient and contemporary that reflects the community's vision.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <img src="img/community-art.jpg" alt="Public art installation" class="card-img">
            <h3>Storytelling Art</h3>
            <p>Public art installations throughout the residential areas share the history, teachings, and contemporary stories of Treaty One Nations. Murals, sculptures, and landscape features incorporate traditional symbols and motifs while allowing for contemporary artistic expression.</p>
            <p>Each neighborhood features story poles or plaques explaining the significance of local art pieces in multiple languages (English, French, Anishinaabemowin, and Dakota). Interactive sound installations allow residents to hear traditional stories and songs tied to specific locations within the community.</p>

            <h3>Sustainable Living</h3>
            <p>All residential buildings at Naawi-Oodena meet or exceed LEED Gold standards for environmental performance, with many achieving Platinum certification. Energy efficiency measures reduce utility costs by an average of 40% compared to conventional homes, while renewable energy systems including solar panels and geothermal heating minimize environmental impact.</p>
            <p>The community's district energy system provides efficient heating and cooling to all homes, with backup systems ensuring reliability. Water conservation features like low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting systems, and drought-resistant landscaping reduce water use by 50% compared to conventional developments.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Community Connection</h3>
            <p>Residential areas are designed to foster connection between neighbors while respecting privacy. Shared spaces like community kitchens, fire pits, and gathering circles encourage regular interaction and relationship-building. Monthly neighborhood feasts and seasonal celebrations organized by community liaisons help maintain strong social bonds.</p>
            <p>Each residential cluster has a designated community steward who helps organize events, facilitates conflict resolution, and serves as a liaison with the broader community administration. This system ensures residents have support while maintaining the self-governance principles important to Indigenous communities.</p>

Our children play in parks where they learn the names of plants in Anishinaabemowin, and we can walk to ceremonies at the cultural center. The home designs beautifully blend modern comforts with traditional elements - we have a small ceremonial space in our backyard that's become so important for our family's spiritual life."
