      <p>Naawi-Oodena is a new community being built on the former Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg. It will be a place where people can live, work, and play together. The name "Naawi-Oodena" means "four rivers" in Anishinaabe, representing the four rivers that flow through the area.</p>        
      <h2>Residential Living</h2>
      <p>Naawi-Oodena will include both low-density (houses) and medium-density (apartments) homes. These areas are built to be safe, affordable, and beautiful for families of all sizes.</p>
      <p>We want to make sure that everyone can find a home that fits their needs. The residential areas will have parks, schools, and shops nearby, making it easy for families to live, work, and play in the same area.</p>
