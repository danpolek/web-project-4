            Naawi-Oodena is a transformative 156-acre urban reserve development on the former Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
            As the largest urban reserve in Canada, this $1 billion project represents a landmark achievement in Indigenous-led development 
            and urban planning. The name "Naawi-Oodena" translates to "Centre of the Heart" in Anishinaabemowin, reflecting both its geographic 
            centrality in Winnipeg and its spiritual significance to Treaty One Nations.

          <p>
            The development is led by Treaty One Nation, a collective of seven Anishinaabe First Nations: Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, 
            Long Plain First Nation, Peguis First Nation, Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation, Sagkeeng First Nation, Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation, 
            and Swan Lake First Nation. This project represents the largest single return of urban land to First Nations in Canadian history.

        <h2>Why Naawi-Oodena Matters</h2>
        <div class="importance-content">
          <p>
            Naawi-Oodena represents a new model for urban Indigenous economic development in Canada. The project is expected to generate 
            $2.8 billion in economic impact over 20 years, creating 10,000 construction jobs and 4,000 permanent positions. Importantly, 
            60% of these opportunities will be reserved for Indigenous workers and businesses.
          </p>
