      <p>
        Naawi-Oodena is an extraordinary urban reserve located on the former Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
        Led by Treaty One Nations, it symbolizes peace, unity, and reconciliation. 
        "Naawi-Oodena" means "Centre of the Heart" in Anishinaabemowin, and it reflects the vision of Indigenous-led development.

      <h3>Why Naawi-Oodena Matters</h3>
      <p>
        This site sets a new standard for Indigenous urban development. It empowers local communities, honors history,
        and strengthens the connection between Indigenous culture and the land.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s unique is that Naawi-Oodena combines First Nations traditional values and cultures with modern city planning 
        processes like zoning, roads, and green infrastructure. It shows real partnership between Indigenous traditions and 
        urban planning. This model can influence future projects across Canada and beyond.

      <h3>The Finished Product</h3>
      <p>
        Naawi-Oodena has become a thriving, modern community that blends Indigenous culture with urban living. 
        As Canada’s largest urban reserve, it now stands as a powerful symbol of reconciliation and self-determination for the Treaty One First Nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The residential area features a wide variety of homes, including detached houses, townhomes, stacked townhouses, and apartment buildings. 
        Families of all sizes found suitable housing, with many units designed to be affordable and inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The partnership between Treaty One, Canada Lands Company, and the City of Winnipeg ensured that a strong mix of market-rate and affordable 
        housing was available from the start. The first residential phase was a major success, adding 260 housing units just north of Taylor Avenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design encouraged community engagement with walking paths, green spaces, and a layout that connects seamlessly with nearby neighborhoods like Tuxedo.
